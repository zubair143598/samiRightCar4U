There are many great options such as Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Hyundai, and others that are affordable, last many years, don’t break down so easily, and are the perfect types of car to get started with. We can have a basic filter that gives them such options as well as basic needs such as heating, air conditioning, trunk space, number of miles per gallon, whether the car is electric or hybrid or combustion engine. Our user will be delighted to know that they won’t have to search individually anymore, but have all those options right by their fingertips.",

For example, a user may own a construction company and needs a strong, sturdy truck that has great trunk space, and is capable of driving in heavy snow, rain, and even withstand hail. The user will instantly have access to many different trucks with the features and specs they need their truck to be able to have, as well as price range, mileage, capability, and horsepower. ",

By filtering out cars with tinted windows, luxury category, price, color, and horsepower which makes the car roam louder when it drives faster, our user will be happy to know they have so many varieties to choose from and can narrow it down with any more specific details that they would like.",
